# What’s next?
•	Congratulations!! You have successfully debugged ‘Feed the Dino’ game! Way to go – you are officially a developer now. Believe me, this is how coding/developing works.

•	We have provided you another game with intentional bugs int it as a take home activity. If you liked working through ‘Feed the Dino’ project, and are interested in more such debugging challenges, work through another debugging activity https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/448127440/.<project will be made available shortly after the conclusion of the session>. You can add more intentional bugs into the project and challenge your friends to debug it.


## The Golden Rule
Don’t ever be afraid to ask questions. Programming is hard and everyone needs help. Ask questions if you need help with anything! For any questions after the session, please dend your questions to ng-ywit-questions@netapp.com with the workshop title "Catch Bugs With Us" in the email subject line. All of the code from the workshop will be available in a GitHub repository for reference.
