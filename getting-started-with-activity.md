# Getting Started with Activity:
Do you have a Scratch account? If not, please create one using the link https://scratch.mit.edu/

â€¢	Once you have your Scratch account , go to the project page (https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/448126075/) (**project will be made available shortly before the start of the session**) and click the REMIX button at the top of the project to create your own copy of it!

Read the project description to understand how the game is supposed to work and start hacking away!

Can you find out all the 12 bugs in the project?


## Finished with your project?
### Are you sure?
â€¢	A programmerâ€™s work is never done! Thereâ€™s always room to improve upon your projectâ€”making it even better. Try to include your ideas into the game to make it more interesting ðŸ˜Š. You can add more intentional bugs into the project and challenge your friends to debug it.

## The Golden Rule
Donâ€™t ever be afraid to ask questions. Programming is hard and everyone needs help. Ask questions if you need help with anything! For any questions after the session, please send your questions to ng-ywit-questions@netapp.com with the workshop title "Catch Bugs With Us" in the email subject line. All the solutions from the workshop will be made available in this GitHub repository shortly after the conclusion of the session.
